## Overview

The objective of this project is to build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.  The users will be able to:
1.  Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
2.  Choose a color.
3.  Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

This project exercises the following front-end programming skills:
-   Defining variables with `const` and `let`
-   Accessing the DOM using methods of the `document` object
-   Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
-   Writing nested loops and using loop variables
